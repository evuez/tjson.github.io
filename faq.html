<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<br>

<h5>Q: Why not use a binary format like BSON, MessagePack, or Protobufs?</h5>
<p>
  A: TJSON is intended to supplement binary message formats, not replace them.
  It provides a syntax which should be able to express most of the same types
  as binary formats in both a human readable/writable and cryptographically
  authenticatable manner. It should also hopefully support lossless bidirectional
  transcoding to and from binary formats.
</p>

<h5>Q: Why isn't there a TJSON implementation available for my language yet?</h5>
<p>
  A: Language support for TJSON is scant right now, but we're working on it.
  Feel free to make a TJSON implementation for your language, and if you'd
  like, request to host it under the TJSON GitHub organization.
</p>

<p>
  In the meantime you can consume TJSON documents by stripping off the tags
  and doing manual postprocessing. Chances are if you're working with rich
  types in JSON documents, you're probably doing this postprocessing by hand
  already.
</p>

<h5>Q: What additional features are planned?</h5>
<p>
  A: TJSON is intended to support format-independent cryptographic authentication
  using the <a href="https://github.com/benlaurie/objecthash">objecthash</a>
  content hash algorithm. This algorithm produces digests which are the same
  same whether a document is encoded in a binary format or encoded as TJSON.
